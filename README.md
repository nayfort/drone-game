# Drone Game

### This is a Drone Game test task. 
#### The goal of the task is to implement a frontend part of a very simple game. To put it briefly: the player controls the drone, which goes down the flexuous cave. There are only two outcomes: either drone reaches the cave exit (winning scenario), or the drone crashes into the cave wall (loosing scenario).
